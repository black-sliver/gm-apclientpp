# GM-APClientPP

Work in progress.

This is a native ("C") Game Maker compatible wrapper for the C++ Archipelago Client Lib
[apclientpp](https://github.com/black-sliver/apclientpp),
allowing to connect to an [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) server with native performance and SSL support.

## Supported Game Maker

This was written for Game Maker 7 and 8, however all versions of GM that support the API described in "Using DLL" in
"Designing Games with Game Maker" of GM7/GM8 should be supported.
It only depends on `external_define` and `external_call`. This is not an "extension" (.gex) file.

For GM7/GM8, `execute_string` can be used to handle events. For GMS, an alternative to this is provided.

GMS2 string syntax support exists and can be activated by specifying it through `api_version`, as explained further below.

## API Limitations

* Arrays have to be passed as JSON string from GM to the DLL.
* Arrays have to be passed as globals from the DLL to GM callback functions/scripts.
* There is a limit of how many arguments can be passed into DLL functions and as such there are some extra helper
  functions to "pre-set" arguments.
* DLL functions that have no return value will return true on success or false in case of error.

## Types

GM only has `number` and `string`, so the types listed below are defined as follows

* `int` is a `number` with an integer value in the range Â± 2<sup>53</sup>-1
* `bool` is a `number` with value `0` for `false` or `not 0` (typically `1`) for `true`.
   This is different from GM's boolean handling where true / false is `>=0.5` / `<0.5`.
* `str` is a `string` in GM, and a `const char*` in C
* `json` is a `str` that is valid json. A json array is `'[...]'`, a json object is `'{...}'`.
* `int[]` is either a `json` array of numbers (GM -> DLL) or a global array variable in GM (DLL -> GM)
* `str[]` is either a `json` array of strings (GM -> DLL) or a global array variable in GM (DLL -> GM)
* `double` is a `number` in GM, and a `double` in C.

## API

Below are the possible calls from GM to DLL. The actual call uses `external_call`, but should be wrapped in a script
with the same name, making the calls possible as listed below. See [gml/](gml/).

We use the following notation below: `name(arg_name: arg_type, ...): return_type`

**Warning:** some of the functions will only return correct values after room info or when `is_data_package_valid()`
  returns true, typically it's safe to just wait until `ap_connected` event was called.

* `apclient_init(api_version: int): bool` initialize the lib and set API version (where `1 <= api_version <= 2`, increase by 200 for GMS2 string syntax support),
   returns `true` on success.
* `apclient_deinit(): bool` free all resources (kind of optional, but has to be called before a second `apclient_init`)
* `apclient_connect(uuid: str, game: str, host: str): bool` start connecting to a server.
   uuid can be an empty string (for now).
* `apclient_poll(): str` call this each frame (step) to handle communication and receive events,
   returns a string that needs to be executed using `execute_string` to call your event callbacks.
* `apclient_disconnect(): bool` reset internal state and disconnect.
* `apclient_reset(): bool` reset internal state and reconnect on next `poll`.
* `apclient_get_player_alias(slot: int): str` returns player alias, player name, or `'Unknown'` for given slot.
* `apclient_get_player_game(slot: int): str` returns game name or `''` for given slot.
* `apclient_get_game(): str` returns currently played game name or `''`.
* `apclient_get_location_name(id: int, game: str): str` returns location name or `'Unknown'` for given id and game.
* `apclient_get_location_id(name: str): int` returns location id for given name in connected game,
   or `< -9007199254740991` if not found.
* `apclient_get_item_name(id: int, game: str): str` like location_name, but for items.
* `apclient_get_item_id(name: str): int` like location_id, but for items.
* `apclient_render_json(json: str, format: int): str` takes a json string as received by `ap_print_json` event and
   turns it into text. Pass `0` (or `global.AP_RENDER_FORMAT_TEXT`) as format to receive plain text.
* `apclient_get_state(): int` returns one of the internal state values, see constants `global.AP_STATE_*`.
* `apclient_get_seed(): str` returns seed for connected room or `''` if not connected yet
* `apclient_get_slot(): str` returns connecting player (slot) name or `""` if `connect_slot` wasn't called yet.
* `apclient_get_player_number(): int` returns player number for connected player, or -1 if not connected yet.
* `apclient_get_team_number(): int` returns team number for connected player, or -1 if not connected yet.
* `apclient_get_hint_points(): int` returns hint points for connected player.
* `apclient_get_hint_cost_points(): int` returns hint cost in points (locations checked).
* `apclient_get_hint_cost_percent(): int` returns hint cost in percent (% of locations checked).
* `apclient_is_data_package_valid(): bool` returns `true` if all strings for item and location names are available.
* `apclient_get_server_time(): number`: returns the estimated server time stamp as floating point number.
   This may be useful for things like deathlink.
* `apclient_has_password(): bool`: available in and after `ap_room_info`, `true` if `connect_slot` requires password.
* `apclient_get_checked_locations(): str`: returns a string that should be passed into `execute_string`
   to set `global.ap_checked_locations: int[]` and `global.ap_checked_locations_len: int`
* `apclient_get_missing_locations(): str`: returns a string that should be passed into `execute_string`
   to set `global.ap_missing_locations: int[]` and `global.ap_missing_locations_len: int`
* `apclient_bounce(data: json): bool` sends a Bounce with the provided data and the targets selected through
   `apclient_set_bounce_targets`.
* `apclient_death_link(cause: string): bool` sends a DeathLink Bounce with the provided cause, unless cause is an
   empty string, in which case it will be omitted. The time and source are retrieved automatically. Targets selected through
   `apclient_set_bounce_targets` will be ignored in favor of sending the Bounce only to the DeathLink tag.

Some of the events require the return of data that is difficult to represent directly in GM. To remedy this, the data is
stored in JSON form and made accessible through function calls. If an event is received in response to `apclient_poll`,
the following functions can be used to query its corresponding JSON data until the next call to `apclient_poll`. Most of
the events do not require these functions, as long as `execute_string` is available.

These functions take a `proxy`, which is an `int` that represents a location in the JSON data. When data is first
accessed after an event only `proxy = 0` is available, which represents the root level. Some of these functions also take
a `key`, which is the name of the element to be accessed. If the data at `proxy` is an array, then `key` must be a `str`
representing a number equal to or greater than 0.

* `apclient_json_proxy(proxy: int, key: str): int` returns a new `proxy`, making the data at `key` available through its use,
   if `key` is not found at `proxy`, `-1` is returned instead.
* `apclient_json_exists(proxy: int, key: str): bool` return `true` if `key` can be found at `proxy`.
* `apclient_json_typeof(proxy: int): int` returns the type of `proxy`, which will be one of the JSON type constants set up
   in init.
* `apclient_json_size(proxy: int): int` returns the number of elements at `proxy`.
* `apclient_json_get_string(proxy: int): str` if `proxy` is of type `AP_JSON_STRING`, returns its value.
* `apclient_json_string_at(proxy: int, key: str): str` shorthand for `apclient_json_get_string(apclient_json_proxy(proxy, key))`.
* `apclient_json_get_number(proxy: int): double` if `proxy` is of type `AP_JSON_NUMBER`, returns its value.
* `apclient_json_number_at(proxy: int, key: str): double` shorthand for `apclient_json_get_number(apclient_json_proxy(proxy, key))`.
* `apclient_json_dump(proxy: int): str` returns the `json` corresponding to `proxy`.
* `apclient_json_source(): str` returns the name of the event that made the data available.

The following functions set variables that would normally be passed into another function, but can't be because of GM
limitations.

* `apclient_set_items_handling(items_handling: int): bool` set the items handling that will be passed to ConnectSlot
   and ConnectUpdate.
* `apclient_set_version(ma: int, mi: int, r: int): bool` set the mod/client version that will be passed to ConnectSlot.
* `apclient_set_bounce_targets(games: str[], slots: int[], tags: str[]): bool` set the games, slot IDs and tags that
   will be passed to Bounce.

The following functions interact directly with the AP server and return `true` if the command was successfully queue,
or false if the command was invalid or the connection was not established yet.

* `apclient_say(message: str): bool` sends a chat message
* `apclient_connect_slot(name: str, password: str, tags: json): bool` connects to a slot.
   Wait for `connected` or `connection_refused` event to get the result.
* `apclient_connect_update_items_handling(): bool` send ConnectUpdate, only changing items_handling.
* `apclient_connect_update(tags: str[]): bool` send ConnectUpdate, changing both tags and items_handling.
* `apclient_sync(): bool` send Sync message, this should not be needed.
* `apclient_status_update(status: int): bool` sends StatusUpdate message, see `AP_CLIENT_STATUS_*` constants.
* `apclient_location_checks(locations: int[]): bool` sends LocationChecks, marking locations as checked.
* `apclient_location_scouts(locations: int[], create_as_hints: int): bool` sends LocationScouts.
   Wait for `location_info` event to get the result.

### Not implemented

The following are not implemented.
Open for suggestions / requests.

* `apclient_get_players(): List[NetWorkPlayer]` the return type of this is not easy to implement in GM.
* `apclient_get(...): bool` data storage / GetReply and Received not implemented yet
* `apclient_set_notify(...): bool` as above
* `apclient_set(...): bool` as above

## Constants

The following consts should be set up in the init:

* `global AP_RENDER_FORMAT_TEXT = 0` - get plain text from render_json
* `global AP_RENDER_FORMAT_HTML = 1` - this can't be used at the moment because it's not implemented in render_json.
* `global AP_RENDER_FORMAT_ANSI = 2` - get ansi (terminal) color codes from render_json
* `global.AP_STATE_DISCONNECTED = 0` - disconnected
* `global.AP_STATE_SOCKET_CONNECTING = 1` - connect started
* `global.AP_STATE_SOCKET_CONNECTED = 2` - network connection accepted, nothing received yet
* `global.AP_STATE_ROOM_INFO = 3` - room info was received, slot not connected yet
* `global.AP_STATE_SLOT_CONNECTED = 4` - slot successfully connected, can send/receive locations/items and chat, etc.
* `global.AP_CLIENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN = 0` - default status
* `global.AP_CLIENT_STATUS_READY = 10` - player is ready to play (setting this is optional at the moment)
* `global.AP_CLIENT_STATUS_PLAYING = 20` - player is playing their game (as above)
* `global.AP_CLIENT_STATUS_GOAL = 30` - player reached their goal.
   Use this in `apclient_status_update` on goal completion.
* `global.AP_JSON_MISSING = -1` - returned by `apclient_json_typeof` when failing to determine the type.
* `global.AP_JSON_OBJECT = 0` - returned by `apclient_json_typeof` when the value at `proxy` is a json object.
* `global.AP_JSON_ARRAY = 1` - returned by `apclient_json_typeof` when the value at `proxy` is an array.
* `global.AP_JSON_STRING = 2` - returned by `apclient_json_typeof` when the value at `proxy` is compatible with `string`.
* `global.AP_JSON_NUMBER = 3` - returned by `apclient_json_typeof` when the value at `proxy` is compatible with `number`.
* `global.AP_JSON_NULL = 4` - returned by `apclient_json_typeof` when the value at `proxy` is `null`.

## Events

The script returned by `apclient_poll` expects the following functions to exist in your scripts to handle events,
so you need to define all of them:

* `ap_room_info(data: json)` called when receiving RoomInfo from server, argument is currently unused (`'{}'`),
   but the JSON calls can be used to retrieve the data.
* `ap_slot_refused(len: int)` called when `apclient_connect_slot` failed, len is the size of error messages,
   messages can be retrieved from `global.arg_errors: str[]`.
* `ap_slot_connected(slot_data: json)` called when `apclient_connect_slot` succeeded
* `ap_items_received(index: int, len: int)` called when receiving items, index is the "item index" of the first item
   that was received, len is the number of items that were received.
   Use `global.arg_ids: int[]`, `global.arg_names: str[]`, `global.arg_flags: int[]`, `global.arg_players: int[]`
   and `global.arg_locations: int[]` to retrieve the items.
* `ap_location_info(len: int)` called as result of a scout, len is the number of results (individual scouts).
   Use `global.arg_locations: int[]`, `global.arg_items: int[]`, `global.arg_flags: int[]`
   and `global.arg_players: int[]` to get the corresponding location ids and item ids.
* `ap_location_checked(len: int)` called when locations for the connected slot were checked, len is the count.
   Use `global.arg_ids: int[]` to retrieve the checked locations ids.
* `ap_print_json(message: json)` pass `message` back in to render_json to get a human readable text
* `ap_socket_connected()` network connection established, useful to postpone connection timeouts, `room_info` will
   automatically be received later.
* `ap_socket_disconnected()` network connection died, can't send things until reconnected.
* `ap_socket_error(error: str)` network connection failed. Useful for debugging, but client will retry internally.
   Either keep a count of errors (abort for >2 failed attempts) or use a timeout for `ap_room_info` (abort after >5sec).
* `ap_bounced(bounce: json)` called when receiving Bounced from server.
   The JSON calls can be used to retrieve the data.

These events also make the following JSON data available through the `apclient_json_...` calls:

* `ap_slot_refused` { "len": `int`, "reasons" : `str[]` }
* `ap_slot_connected` see "slot_data" of [Connected](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/network%20protocol.md#connected).
* `ap_items_received` { "index": `int`, "len": `int`, "ids": `int[]`, "names": `str[]`, "flags": `int[]`, "players": `int[]`, "locations": `int[]` }
* `ap_location_info` { "len": `int`, "items": `int[]`, "flags": `int[]`, "players": `int[]`, "locations": `int[]` }
* `ap_location_checked` { "len": `int`, "locations": `int[]` }
* `ap_print_json` see [PrintJSON](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/network%20protocol.md#printjson).
* `ap_socket_error` { "message": `str` }
* `ap_bounced` see [Bounced](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/network%20protocol.md#bounced).

Additionally, these built-in GM functions may be called by an `apclient_poll` script:

* `show_message(message: str): none` when an exception occurs.

If this happens, the following JSON data is made available:

* `show_message` { "message": `str` }

### Not implemented

The following are not implemented.

* `ap_retrieved(...)` result for `apclient_get`
* `ap_set_reply(...)` when a player sent a Set that matches your SetNotify

## API version differences

### Version 1

Initial version.

### Version 2

Bounce implemented through the following calls:
* `apclient_bounce`
* `apclient_death_link`
* `apclient_set_bounce_targets`

The `ap_bounced` event is now supported.
